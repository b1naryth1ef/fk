# fk
fk is a shell/terminal emulator/ecosphere for the future. It was inspired somewhat from [this](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/a-whole-new-world) talk. fk is built on awesome modernish (hipsterish) technologies like Go and Lua. Woah bro, so modern. It was built to be sorta-backwards compatible with some shit, and to throw random un-understandable errors at other shit. It might get finished never.
